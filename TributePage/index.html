            <p><span class="bold underline">J. Robert Oppenheimer</span> (1904 - 1967) was an American theoretical
                physicist. A professor of physics at the University of California, Oppenheimer was the wartime head of
                the Los Alamos Laboratory, and is often credited as the <span class="bold large">"father of the atomic
                    bomb"</span> for his role in the <span class="italic"><span class="bold">Manhattan
                        Project</span>—the World War II undertaking—</span>that developed the <span
                    class="underline">world's first nuclear weapon</span>.</p>
            <p>Oppenheimer was among those who observed the <span class="italic">Trinity test</span> in New Mexico,
                where the first atomic bomb was successfully detonated on July 16, 1945. In August 1945, the weapons
                were used in the atomic bombings of <span class="italic bold">Hiroshima and Nagasaki</span>. After the
                war ended, Oppenheimer became chairman of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly
                created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He used that position to lobby for <span
                    class="underline">international control of nuclear power</span>, to avert nuclear proliferation and
                a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. He opposed the <span class="underline">development of the
                    hydrogen bomb</span> during a 1949 – 1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took
                stances on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government and military factions.
            </p>
            <p>During the Second Red Scare, those stances, together with past associations Oppenheimer had with people
                and organizations affiliated with the Communist Party, led to the revocation of his security clearance
                in a much-written-about hearing in 1954. Effectively stripped of his direct political influence, he
                continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. Nine years later, President John F. Kennedy awarded
                (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented him with) the <span class="bold">Enrico Fermi Award</span> as a gesture
                of political rehabilitation. In 2022, five decades after his death, the U.S. government formally
                nullified its 1954 decision and affirmed Oppenheimer's loyalty.</p>
            <p>Oppenheimer's achievements in physics include: the <span class="bold">Born–Oppenheimer approximation for
                    <span class="medium underline">molecular wave functions</span></span>, work on the <span
                    class="bold">theory of electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in <span
                        class="medium underline">nuclear fusion</span>, and the first prediction of <span
                        class="medium underline">quantum tunneling</span></span>. With his students he also made
                important contributions to the modern theory of <span class="bold medium">neutron stars and black
                    holes</span>, as well as to <span class="bold">quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and the
                    interactions of cosmic rays</span>. As a teacher and promoter of science, he is remembered as a
                founding father of the American school of theoretical physics that gained world prominence in the 1930s.
                After World War II, he became director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>
