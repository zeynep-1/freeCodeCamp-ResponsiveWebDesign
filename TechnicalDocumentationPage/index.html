            <p>Python is a <span class="underline">high-level, general-purpose</span> programming language. Its design
                philosophy emphasizes code
                readability with the use of significant indentation via the <span class="bold">off-side rule</span>.</p>
            <p>Python is <span class="underline">dynamically typed and garbage-collected</span>. It supports multiple
                programming paradigms,
                including <span class="bold">structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional
                    programming</span>. It is
                often described as a <span class="italic">"batteries included"</span> language due to its comprehensive
                standard library.</p>
            <p><span class="medium bold">Guido van Rossum</span> began working on Python in the late 1980s as a
                successor to the ABC programming
                language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python
                3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier
                versions.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming
                    languages.</span></p>

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as <span class="bold large">JS</span>, is a programming language that is
                one of the
                core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use
                JavaScript on the <span class="italic">client side for webpage behavior</span>, often incorporating
                third-party libraries. All
                major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a <span class="underline">high-level, often just-in-time compiled</span> language that
                conforms to the <span class="bold medium">ECMAScript</span>
                standard. It has <span class="bold">dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                    functions</span>.
                It is <span class="bold">multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative</span>
                programming styles. It has
                <span class="medium">application programming interfaces (APIs)</span> for working with text, dates,
                regular expressions,
                standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
            </p>
            <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs
                for I/O.</p>
            <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of
                some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is
                <span class="large">Node.js</span>.

                <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Computer security, cybersecurity (cyber security), digital security or information technology
                security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from attack by malicious
                actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware,
                software, or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.</p>
            <p>The field has become of significance due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the
                Internet, and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of
                smart devices that constitute the
                Internet of things (IoT). Cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenges of the
                contemporary world, due to both the complexity of information systems and the societies they
                support. Security is of especially high importance for systems that govern large-scale systems with
                far-reaching physical effects.</p>
            <p>A <span class="large bold">vulnerability</span> is a weakness in design, implementation, operation, or internal control. Most of the
                vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the <span class="underline">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
                    (CVE)</span> database. An exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or
                exploit exists. Vulnerabilities can be researched, reverse-engineered, hunted, or exploited
                using automated tools or customized scripts.</p>
            <p>To secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it,
                and these threats can typically be classified into one of these categories below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Backdoor</li>
                <li>Denial-of-service attack (DoS)</li>
                <li>Direct-access attacks</li>
                <li>Eavesdropping</li>
                <li>Multi-vector, polymorphic attacks</li>
                <li>Phishing</li>
                <li>Privilege escalation</li>
                <li>Reverse engineering</li>
                <li>Side-channel attack</li>
                <li>Social engineering</li>
                <li>Spoofing</li>
                <li>Tampering</li>
                <li>Malware</li>
                <li>HTML smuggling</li>
